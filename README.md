# Binary Trees

Welcome to your comprehensive guide to Binary Trees in C++! This repository delves into their structure, operations, traversal techniques, and provides curated practice problems from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks to solidify your understanding.

# Sections:

## Introduction

Define Binary Trees: hierarchical data structure with at most two child nodes (left and right)

Explain their benefits: efficient for searching and sorting (especially in Binary Search Trees)

## Node Structure : 

Design a Node class to represent a binary tree node:

Data member to store the node's value

Pointers to left and right child nodes (can be nullptr if empty)

## Tree Operations :

Code examples demonstrating:

Creation of a binary tree (including dynamic allocation)

Insertion of elements (consider recursive and iterative approaches)

Deletion of elements (handle different cases like leaf nodes, single child nodes, etc.)

Searching for a specific value (recursive and iterative)

## Traversal Techniques :

Explore different traversal methods and their applications:

Inorder Traversal: Visit left subtree, root, then right subtree (useful for printing sorted elements in a Binary Search Tree)

Preorder Traversal: Visit root, left subtree, then right subtree (common for tree serialization/deserialization)

Postorder Traversal: Visit left subtree, right subtree, then root (used for tree deletion or expression evaluation)

Implement each traversal method recursively and iteratively (using stacks)

Provide code examples and visualizations (diagrams or ASCII art) to illustrate the traversal paths
